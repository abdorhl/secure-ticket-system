- **Strict Mode**: Enabled `session.use_strict_mode`
- **SameSite**: Set to `Strict` for CSRF protection
- **Session Regeneration**: Automatic session ID regeneration every 5 minutes
- **Session Timeout**: 1-hour session lifetime

### 3. Security Headers
- **X-Frame-Options**: Set to `DENY` to prevent clickjacking
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Set to `nosniff` to prevent MIME sniffing
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Set to `1; mode=block` for XSS protection
- **Referrer-Policy**: Set to `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Enabled for HTTPS environments

- **Password Security**: Enhanced password hashing with `PASSWORD_DEFAULT`
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with regeneration
- **Logging**: Comprehensive login attempt logging

### 5. File Upload Security
- **File Type Validation**: MIME type and extension checking
- **File Size Limits**: 5MB maximum file size
- **Image Verification**: `getimagesize()` validation for actual images
- **Secure Filenames**: Random filename generation to prevent conflicts
- **Directory Permissions**: Proper upload directory permissions (0755)
- **File Scanning**: Enhanced file validation and logging

### 6. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **XSS Prevention**: `htmlspecialchars()` with proper encoding
- **SQL Injection**: Comprehensive pattern detection
- **Input Sanitization**: Centralized sanitization functions
- **Validation Rules**: Comprehensive input validation framework

### 7. Security Configuration
- **Centralized Config**: Created `security-config.php` with all security settings
- **Constants**: Defined security constants for consistency
- **Validation Functions**: Password strength validation
- **Pattern Detection**: SQL injection and XSS pattern detection
- **Logging Framework**: Comprehensive security event logging
