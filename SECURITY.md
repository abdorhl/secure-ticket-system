# Security Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Ticket System and the CI/CD security pipeline.

## Security Features

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **Password Security**: Passwords are hashed using PHP's `password_hash()` with `PASSWORD_DEFAULT`
- **Session Management**: Secure session configuration with HTTP-only cookies
- **Role-based Access**: Separate user and admin dashboards with appropriate permissions
- **Login Protection**: Rate limiting and account lockout after failed attempts

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: All database queries use prepared statements
- **XSS Protection**: User input is sanitized using `htmlspecialchars()`
- **File Upload Security**: Strict file type and extension validation
- **Input Length Limits**: Maximum input lengths to prevent buffer overflow attacks

### 3. Database Security
- **Prepared Statements**: All SQL queries use parameterized statements
- **Soft Delete**: Sensitive data is marked as deleted rather than permanently removed
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all ticket modifications
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted at rest

### 4. File Upload Security
- **Type Validation**: Only image files (JPEG, PNG, GIF) are allowed
- **Extension Checking**: File extensions are validated against MIME types
- **Size Limits**: Maximum file size of 5MB per upload
- **Secure Storage**: Uploaded files are stored outside the web root

## CI/CD Security Pipeline

### Automated Security Tests
The security pipeline runs on every push and pull request, performing the following checks:

1. **PHP Security Analysis**
   - PHPStan security rules
   - Psalm security analysis
   - Composer security checker

2. **OWASP Dependency Check**
   - Vulnerability scanning of dependencies
   - Known security issues detection
   - License compliance checking

3. **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**
   - Semgrep security rules
   - OWASP Top 10 compliance
   - PHP-specific security patterns

4. **CodeQL Analysis**
   - GitHub's advanced security analysis
   - Custom security queries
   - Vulnerability detection

5. **Database Security Testing**
   - SQL injection prevention verification
   - Prepared statement validation
   - Database connection security

6. **Authentication Security Testing**
   - Session security configuration
   - Password hashing verification
   - Authentication flow validation

7. **File Upload Security Testing**
   - File type validation
   - Extension checking
   - Upload security measures

8. **XSS & CSRF Testing**
   - Cross-site scripting prevention
   - CSRF token generation
   - Input sanitization verification

9. **Security Headers Testing**
   - HTTP security headers validation
   - HTTPS redirect testing
   - Content Security Policy verification

10. **Performance & Load Testing**
    - Application performance under load
    - Resource usage monitoring
    - Response time analysis

### Running Security Tests Locally

To run security tests locally, use the provided security test script:

```bash
php security-test.php
```

This will perform basic security checks including:
- PHP version and extension verification
- Session security configuration
- Password hashing validation
- SQL injection protection
- XSS protection
- File upload security
- CSRF token generation
- Input validation
- Error reporting configuration

### Security Configuration

The security configuration is defined in `security-config.yml` and includes:

- OWASP Top 10 security checks
- File upload restrictions
- Authentication requirements
- Database security settings
- Security headers configuration
- Input validation rules
- Security logging settings

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. Always use prepared statements for database queries
2. Sanitize all user input before processing
3. Validate file uploads thoroughly
4. Use HTTPS in production
5. Keep dependencies updated
6. Follow the principle of least privilege
7. Log security events appropriately

### For Deployment
1. Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
2. Enable security headers
3. Configure proper session settings
4. Set up monitoring and alerting
5. Regular security updates
6. Backup and recovery procedures
7. Access control and authentication

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **DO NOT** create a public issue
2. Email security concerns to: [security@yourcompany.com]
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for response and fix

## Security Updates

Security updates are released as needed. Please:

1. Keep your installation updated
2. Monitor security advisories
3. Test updates in a staging environment
4. Follow the update procedures in the main README

## Compliance

This system is designed to comply with:
- OWASP Top 10
- GDPR data protection requirements
- Industry security standards
- Best practices for web application security
